                What is Capoeira?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that is unique in that it involves singing, playing instruments, and playing
                the martial art. Yes, you read that right. Capoeira is a martial art that is played and not exactly fought. It
                is, in a sense, a social martial art, which focuses more on developing oneself and enjoyment. Well, that is at
                least
                true for many groups which gather around the world as it does vary from one place to another and also with its
                various methods of play. In Rexburg, we see capoeira as what it has been described here. Still, it is not too
                different
                to other martial arts as it does come with a ranking system, ceremonies, and forms of tournaments.
